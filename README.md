# Redux-Syntax-Helper
A tool to help you write the Syntax for Redux.

## Link: http://reduxsyntaxhelper.com/

## Why this Tool?
I've had the experience of the difficulties (as well as many others) when encountering Redux for the first time.
While the Redux documentation is very good and explicit, there are still many confusing situations when dealing with
the standard writings of Redux. When first starting out, it is easy to get overwhelmed by all the nuances of writing the syntax as well as the need
for understanding how React-Redux also comes into play. 

Here I made the effort in creating a web application that allows you to write in simple terms what you want to do in Redux 
and see the immediate syntax output for Redux. It allows you to see the barebone structure of what to write based on what your
needs are. You write your actions, reducers, and components and once you submit, you get to see the syntax.

This web application, while you can, is not meant to replace writing Redux in your code editor altogether (as it would
be very inconvenient) but rather to give you a rough idea on how to write the Redux syntax if you get stuck. This is more of a
developer learning tool more than a replacement for replacing the Redux syntax.

## Prerequisites
No installation required, this is a web application you can find here.


## How to use

Fill out the form to the left:

### Actions:
* First, make sure to save at least one Action
* Add the Action Name as well as it's Logic in the appropriate fields
* Make sure to Save the Action
* Add more Actions if desired.

### Reducers:
* Second, you want to save at least one Reducer
* Add the Reducer Name as well as writing the Reducer's Initial State
* The Reducer's Initial State is the area where you are going to be declaring your state properties
* Connect the desired Actions that will be associated with the Reducer - the Actions will be connected to a particular reducer.
* Add more Reducers if desired.

### Components:
* Third, you want to save at least one Component
* Add the Component Name
* Make sure to connect any actions you want to use in that component.
